[["rubrics.html", "Chapter 8 Rubrics", " Chapter 8 Rubrics Experimental designcraft assessment framework There are at least two primary modes of assessment (Kennedy et al. 2008). Formative assessment can happen during the learning process (Bennett 2011). This active process of engagement with content and doing experiments is critical to becoming an effective life-long learner and successful scientist. In practicing experimental design and doing experiments professionally, this can take the of form of notes, sketches, photographs of the process or experiment at different steps, flowcharts, field and lab notebooks, code, and discussion with collaborators. This process of learning can include feedback from the team (in this course the teaching assistant, the instructor, or peers examining the same challenge). It can be enabled by testing how well one has advanced in achieving specific outcomes. For instance, share your meta-data with a peer and explore whether the individual can understand the meaning of the data and the process of experimentation that supported the collection or reuse of data. Summative assessment can happen at the end of key benchmarks in a learning cycle or at the completion of logical stopping points within the learning process that generated concrete products for review and grading (Taras 2005). In this designcraft process of actively exploring experimental design, this can include production of data with meta-data, a lab report describing the deeper dive for one of the field experiments, and a lab report describing the design process of data reuse from one the examples provided. The process of formative asessment (steps along the way) and summative assessment (final products) should support one another to consolidate learning (Harlen and James 1997). A rubric is a scoring tool that enables fair, transparent and replicable grading in summative evaluation (Timmerman et al. 2011). Checklists are useful for formative self or peer assessment in the steps along the way to final products. In designcraft for experiments, this applies to the published data with meta-data and lab reports. In the formal offering of these labs for the course ‘SC/BIOL 3250 4.00 Experimental design for environmental and evolutionary biology’ at York University, the lab component is worth 50% of the final grade. Rubrics Formative = checklist for you to mentally tick of as you do work. Summative = graded by educator to assess work and provide marks. Formative checklist for pilot dataset This is not the marking key. This is a simple checklist to consider in doing the work or monitoring your progress in the process of doing the pilot experiment. check description criteria 1 design survey patterns locally, plan design 2 identification look up common species, explore field guides 3 dataset download, format, enter data 4 principles sketch design, take field notes 5 principles try different designs and sampling approaches 6 meta-data note units and specifics of your data 7 meta-data take notes, plan how to write methods 8 open science explore figshare, check examples, set up account 9 open science compare your data &amp; meta-data to published, open data 10 innovation consider how to improve and what different designs can test Formative checklist for field dataset This is not the marking key. This is a simple checklist to consider in doing the work or monitoring your progress in the process of doing the field experiment. item description criteria 1 design plan design 2 dataset plan a tidy dataset, ensure variables can test predictions 3 meta-data take detailed notes, record key techniques 4 meta-data get a peer to review data and meta-data 5 open science publish data and meta-data, ensure clear title, location, and details sufficient Summative marking key for published datasets This is the marking key you are looking for. This same key is used for both the pilot and field datasets to ensure that you can improve and learn from the process. item description criteria score 1 data tidy, clear labels, no errors 1 2 data observations meaningful, accuracy, sufficient 1 3 meta-data every variable or column clearly described 1 4 meta-data description ensures the process of observation be repeated by another 1 5 open science published data with meta-data, ensure clear title, location, and details sufficient 1 Formative checklist for field report This is a checklist to consider in writing up the field lab report. check description criteria 1 design explore system and reuse pilot experiment 2 identification examine a key driver within the system 3 research check the publish literature on the topic 4 plan write hypothesis and predictions 5 data collect your field data 6 test test your data with plots and statistics 7 confirm validate your findings with logic and published science 8 plot make a single clear plot of data that summarizing key finding 9 write write up paper 10 conclusions explain the relevance of finding and make a clear conclusion Summative assessment marking key for field lab report This is the marking key for the field lab report.

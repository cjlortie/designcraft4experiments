There are two sets of three exercises provided to explore principles for better experiments. This is a simple book to support the practical, at-home learning associated with experimental design. The text ‘Experimental Design for the Life Sciences’ underpins the design principles (Ruxton and Colgrave. 2018). Life is an experiment. Individually and collectively. We experiment everyday. This is an opportunity to formalize some of those processes and make the learning from experimental design thinking a craft you can apply to all challenges. There are two primary modules to support this process. Field experiments comprises three outdoor experiments to explore sampling heterogeneous, complex processes in natural systems. The purpose is to provide choice. You need to try each, briefly, as a pilot experiment only. Then, select one to pursue in depth and write up as a research article. The data experiments describe the opportunity to use design thinking to structure existing data that others have already collected. The same principles for better experiments still apply in how you reuse the data. There are also three examples provided. Select only one and write up as a note. Both report formats supported by FACETS. It is the first and only open access science journal in Canada. Workflow for pilot and field experiment Do all three field experiments in brief, pilot only, try each for a few hours each. Then, Select one of the first three field experiments to publish data with meta-data. Publish your data with meta-data to an open and public data repository such as figshare. Share the link with all the files with the teaching assistment via the course turnitin.com platform. Select one of the three field experiments to do a deeper dive, i.e. fuller experiment wherein you structure observation by a key variable in the environment. Design experiment, collect data for the deeper dive. Consider combining data from other students that examined the same system. Publish data with meta-data to figshare and submit to teaching assistant via turnitin.com. Write up the field experiment you completed for the deeper dive as a research article for the Canadian open science journal Facets. Submit paper to teaching assistant via turnitin.com. Workflow for the data-design lab report Explore each dataset. Plan a variable to structure your design and analysis. Reuse the data to explore your hypothesis and test your predictions. Write a short research ‘note’ format paper suitable for publication in Facets journal. Submit paper to teaching assistant via turnitin.com.

["birds.html", "Chapter 2 Balcony birdwatching", " Chapter 2 Balcony birdwatching Bird observation, from a distance. Learning outcomes Identify common species of birds locally. Collect a dataset. Connect principles of experimental design to implementation. Write clear and reusable meta-data. Contribute to open science by publishing data and meta-data. Steps Scout out a location with more than a single species of birds and a frequency of a few different individuals of birds over a 5-10 minute duration. Select a good spot to the observe birds at your designated location. It can be a balcony or quiet spot. Vegetation such as trees or shrubs can facilitate observation of birds by providing habitat. Choose a distance that permits enough resolution to see plumage and what an individual bird is doing (depending on whether you are using binoculars, a spotting scope, or unassisted with your vision). There are considerable merits to observing birds more simply (Wilkinson, Waitt, and Gibbs 2014). You are also welcome to address any visibility or spotting challenges using bird calls to record frequency of birds in a sampling region. Specify a duration to sample, for instance, 60 minutes when you have observed the most birds in your scouting exercise. Remember, this is a pilot experiment. Take qualitative notes, sketch, and complete this datasheet. Use your notes to complete a meta-data file, i.e. a description of how the data were collected, whether, when, and what each attribute in your dataset means. Sign out a bird guide for your region from the library or university or try out a free app for now to support identification. Data Here is a sample datasheet for the pilot experiment. This is set up as species-level observations, i.e. each row or replicate is a species of bird you observe. This datasheet is for the pilot experiment, and it is a stepping stone for the deeper dive experiment if you choose to complete this experiment for your first report. A more detailed datasheet can consider duration or start and stop times of each individual bird, more details on the environment, or record interesting ecological or environmental variables that are present in the environment too - noise, disturbance, squirrels, other birds, etc. Data can be organized in many different formats depending on the approach to collecting the data in the field or the lab, the instrument or method used, preference, or accepted standards within the domain of study. In many modern data science endeavours, data are also formatted according to the principles of ‘tidy data’ (Wickham 2014). The following three rules define data as tidy (Grolemund and Wickham 2016). Each variable must have its own column. Each observation must have its own row. Each value must have its own cell. Most scripting languages such as R or Python can resolve and tidy up data to adhere to these principles, but with a little planning, your data can be set up to facilitate this process and enable easier data visualization and models. Sample data set In this example, the field observations were coded as one species per behaviour per row. A compromise between tidiness and ease of collecting the tallies per species in the field. rep date researcher location species frequency behaviour 1 15/9/2020 cl High Park, Toronto House sparrow 12 flying 2 15/9/2020 cl High Park, Toronto Blue jay 2 foraging 3 15/9/2020 cl High Park, Toronto Cedar waxwing 1 perching 4 15/9/2020 cl High Park, Toronto Cedar waxwing 3 foraging 5 15/9/2020 cl High Park, Toronto Dark-eyed junco 2 flying 6 15/9/2020 cl High Park, Toronto Black-capped Chickadee 3 foraging 7 15/9/2020 cl High Park, Toronto Black-capped Chickadee 2 posturing 8 15/9/2020 cl High Park, Toronto Black-capped Chickadee 3 interacting with another bird 9 15/9/2020 cl High Park, Toronto Black-capped Chickadee 2 sitting 10 15/9/2020 cl High Park, Toronto Wood thrush 2 flying 11 15/9/2020 cl High Park, Toronto Wood thrush 5 on ground 12 15/9/2020 cl High Park, Toronto Northern flicker 1 perching in a tree Meta-data In many disciplines of science, meta-data are the descriptive elements of the dataset. They provide a clear means for discovery and reuse of data collected - by you in future and for others (Heidron 2008; Reichman, Jones, and Schildhauer 2011). For the purposes of our practical learning in experimental design here, describe what each column in our dataset means, describe the structure of your dataset (i.e. each row is a species-level observation, or plot, or transect), describe the duration of sampling, location, and provide a bit of guidance for someone to use in inspecting the dataset. It is very similar to the methods in conventional publications or standard reports, but it ensures each attribute in the dataset has a brief description. It is also superb preparation for the methods if you choose to write a report. Deeper dive If you choose this adventure, your goal is to experiment with the method of animal observation to test a hypothesis and predictions. The text ‘Experimental Design for the Life Sciences’ does an excellent job of explaining how to set up hypotheses and predictions (Ruxton and Colgrave. 2018). Pilot experiment first, think, explore your data and notes, then write your ideas down that you want to test. A hypothesis is a clear explanation of how a system works (LaPlaca, Lindgreen, and Vanhamme 2018; Bains 2005). The predictions are logical and resonable outcomes if the hypothesis is a good approximation of how the system works, i.e. the key variables that make it work. Predictions should be testable and read like simple sentences that describe results. The goal of the deeper-dive experiment is to take your pilot experiment, examine what worked and did not work so well in your experiment, and do a deeper and more thorough job of testing a key idea that you are interested in associated with bird communities in your backyward or neighbourhood. The goal should be to explore one key factor the describes how the species locally interact within one another, the environment or other species, or resources. "],

["rubrics.html", "Chapter 8 Rubrics", " Chapter 8 Rubrics Experimental designcraft assessment framework There are at least two primary modes of assessment (Kennedy et al. 2008). Formative assessment can happen during the learning process (Bennett 2011). This active process of engagement with content and doing experiments is critical to becoming an effective life-long learner and successful scientist. In practicing experimental design and doing experiments professionally, this can take the of form of notes, sketches, photographs of the process or experiment at different steps, flowcharts, field and lab notebooks, code, and discussion with collaborators. This process of learning can include feedback from the team (in this course the teaching assistant, the instructor, or peers examining the same challenge). It can be enabled by testing how well one has advanced in achieving specific outcomes. For instance, share your meta-data with a peer and explore whether the individual can understand the meaning of the data and the process of experimentation that supported the collection or reuse of data. Summative assessment can happen at the end of key benchmarks in a learning cycle or at the completion of logical stopping points within the learning process that generated concrete products for review and grading (Taras 2005). In this designcraft process of actively exploring experimental design, this can include production of data with meta-data, a lab report describing the deeper dive for one of the field experiments, and a lab report describing the design process of data reuse from one the examples provided. The process of formative asessment (steps along the way) and summative assessment (final products) should support one another to consolidate learning (Harlen and James 1997). A rubric is a scoring tool that enables fair, transparent and replicable grading in summative evaluation (Timmerman et al. 2011). Checklists are useful for formative self or peer assessment in the steps along the way to final products. In designcraft for experiments, this applies to the published data with meta-data and lab reports. In the formal offering of these labs for the course ‘SC/BIOL 3250 4.00 Experimental design for environmental and evolutionary biology’ at York University, the lab component is worth 50% of the final grade.

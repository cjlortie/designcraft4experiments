# Introduction  

![](./rabbit.png){width=4in}  

Welcome to experimental design. There are two sets of three exercises provided to explore principles for better experiments. This is a simple book to support the practical, at-home learning associated with experimental design. The text 'Experimental Design for the Life Sciences' underpins the design principles [@RN6381].  

Life is an experiment. Individually and collectively. We experiment everyday. This is an opportunity to formalize some of those processes and make the learning from experimental design thinking a craft you can apply to all challenges. There are two primary modules to support this process. 

(1) Field experiments comprises three outdoor experiments to explore sampling heterogeneous, complex processes in natural systems.  The purpose is to provide choice. You need to try each, briefly, as a pilot experiment only. Then, select one to pursue in depth and write up as a research article.  

(2) The data experiments describe the opportunity to use design thinking to structure existing data that others have already collected. The same principles for better experiments still apply in how you reuse the data. There are also three examples provided. Select only one and write up as a note.  

Both report formats supported by [FACETS](https://www.facetsjournal.com/about/). It is the first and only open access science journal in Canada.  

#### Workflow for pilot and field experiment {-} 
1. Do all three field experiments in brief, pilot only, try each for a few hours each.
2. Then, Select one of the first three field experiments to publish data with meta-data.   
3. Publish your data with meta-data to an open and public data repository such as [figshare](https://figshare.com).  
4. Share the link with all the files with the teaching assistment via the course turnitin.com platform.  
5. Select one of the three field experiments to do a deeper dive, i.e. fuller experiment wherein you structure observation by a key variable in the environment.  
6. Design experiment, collect data for the deeper dive.  
7. Consider combining data from other students that examined the same system.
8. Publish data with meta-data to [figshare](https://figshare.com) and submit to teaching assistant via [turnitin.com](https://www.turnitin.com).    
9. Write up the field experiment you completed for the deeper dive as a research article for the Canadian open science journal [Facets](https://www.facetsjournal.com/authors/instructions/).  
10. Submit paper to teaching assistant via [turnitin.com](https://www.turnitin.com).  

#### Field experiments gear {-}  
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
field_gear <- read_csv("./field.csv")
knitr::kable(field_gear, booktabs = TRUE)

```

#### Workflow for the data-design lab report {-}
1. Explore each dataset.  
2. Plan a variable to structure your design and analysis.  
3. Reuse the data to explore your hypothesis and test your predictions.  
4. Write a short research 'note' format paper suitable for publication in [Facets journal](https://www.facetsjournal.com/authors/instructions/).  
5. Submit paper to teaching assistant via [turnitin.com](https://www.turnitin.com).  

#### Data-design experiments gear {-}
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data_gear <- read_csv("./data_design_labs.csv")
knitr::kable(data_gear, booktabs = TRUE)

```
